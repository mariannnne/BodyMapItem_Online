# BodyMapItem_Online
JS scripts for displaying body map items

These files contain the PsiTurk (https://www.psiturk.org) code framework for running the IAPS online projects. The "body map" project includes a question about somatic sensation. Config files have commented areas where authentication values will need to be entered should the project be re-run. The projects were originally run on the OpenShift platform (https://www.openshift.com). -- Code written originally by Eric
